# TYPETR-Assistant

This is our new Assistant Tools environment.
All sources for the BaseAssistant classes and additional functions will be kept here, instead of having them copied inside project repositories.

This will need a bit of extra work and some other UFO selection mechanism, because the tools will no longer know which ufo/ folder is local. And we still need to be able to differentiate glyph sets and design spaces between projects. But avoiding to maintain similar sources probably is worth the effort.

## Usage

* Keep it between the designers that work on TYPETR projects. 
* For the rest you are free to use all tools for your own projects as much as you like.
 
## TYPETR-Polator

A faster and more flexible version of Prepolator.

## Tool wishes

* the “g” key function to place the points at the same place
* bis - with the option of placing the glyph on the left, in the middle or on the right.
* the text sample in fontgoggle.
* save all (and close all).
* color marker on the glyphs you just did
* preview left and right
* I would also add an option of copying spacing from one glyph to another and auto adjusting it, that’s one of my fav things!
