FB Subsetting

A. One discussion of terms to start: 

   1. a Character is the abstract alpha-numeric-etc. that is in your mind, on your keyboard, or in your languageâ€™s script when one considers it abstractly. 

   2. a Glyph is the representation of a character or characters, after whatever conventions of composition are completed for the reader. 

   3. so e.g., the writher often types the A character, but an a appears instead, or the writer types the characters f i n and d and the composition is completed for most readers as the glyphs representing f i n and d, while a few compositions are completed as fi n and d. In Chinese, the four characters, and many more, may all be completed by a single glyph. 
   
    4. Outside of any internal storage formats, and any type specification included in a document, Conventions of Composition are represented in OpenType features

B. Our goal in subsetting is to get a Character list, a convention of composition, find any output requirements, and make a font with the proper Glyphs, Hints, Features in the right Font Format. 

   1. a Character list can come from three primary sources: 
       a. a standard keyboard layout, (e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Arabic), 
       b. the characters in a file (pdf, or html e.g.)
       c. any list of characters. 
   2.  convention of composition breaks down to two things:
       a. an optical type size master,
       b. the script specific OpenType features, and the glyphs they imply beyond the character list.
   3. Output Requirements include:
       a. whatever resolution-specific hinting or mastering is required
       b. the font format and wrapper, 
       c. what file size constraints might exist.

C. So, fonts with the proper Glyphs, Hints, Features an the right Font Format, optimized for Resolution and Portability happen in a lot of different ways, but:
   
    1. For web users, 
       a. a typeface is selected
       b. keyboard layouts, html/CSS files and character lists, all imply or refer to a character list, the character list is converted to glyphs and whatever other glyphs are required for any composites.
       c. whatever page description language is employed calls for specific font sizes, and/or ranges.
       d. the target platform(s) requires hinting or not depending on the glyphs, 
       e. the page description calls for, and the target platform(s) enable Opentype features, leading to the required glyphs for those features, and whatever other glyphs are required for any composites of those glyphs. 
       f. one or more fonts are generated for each require format browsers may need. 

D. okay?
   a. is this how we are setting up?
   b. is this how we want to make out tools work, in design, production, testing and publishing?
   c. is this how we want to encourage our customers to work, incl. F4 & Friends, WT, TNetwork and MS
