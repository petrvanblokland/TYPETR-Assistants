#     toolparts.py
#
#     The toolparts area is used for the storage of tool parts (that otherwise grow too big).
#     These parts are made specifically for tools, so there is no defined API and they better
#     not be used of subclassed by other applications, as they may change without notice.
#
#     The name of the package should be identical to the tool id, in order to avoid future conflicts.
