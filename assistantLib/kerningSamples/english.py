ENGLISH_TEXT = """“With a fitting sense of pride, the designer keeps The Cardboard with 
The Idea covered up for just a little longer. A good idea first needs explanation, because 
if you immediately throw it on the table in front of a client, they won’t understand a thing. 
As with any birth, it is important that it is properly induced. The designer—who also has 
extensive teaching experience in getting uninterested groups moving—delivers a speech about 
the importance of The Idea. About social relevance. About engagement. About the importance 
of The Idea on the iPad. About how original this Idea is, conceived by a hired Artist. 
And about the fact that all vagueness, given sufficient insight, disappears all by itself. 
The designer knows how to build the tension to the absolute limit. The Idea, still invisible 
for now, will meet every expectation. And more than that. All that remains now is the unveiling 
itself. The supreme moment has arrived…”

What does the designer show? We will never know. This scene stops abruptly and leaves the 
reader behind in frustration. We can only guess why the story has an open ending. It is a 
conceptual decision by the author, beyond all criticism, because an artist is always right. 
Even when that’s not the case.

But anyway, suppose we try to finish the story ourselves. After the extensive introduction, 
the designer could conclude that out of all conceivable logo names, the word “Concept” explains 
everything. About the client’s vision and about the innovative character of all future developments. 
The only drawback of this word choice is that searching Google yields more than 800,000,000 hits, 
but the designer has a conceptual solution for that. After research lasting no less than 5 minutes, 
it becomes clear that doubling letters produces an increasingly unique result. So how many are needed?
“Cooncept” gets only 16,600 hits, and only with “Cooooooooooooncept” has the number of pages 
found—mid-December 2012—been reduced to zero. A unique design, then. Incidentally, the name Google 
needs at least 12 o’s to be unique. The rest is already in use by freeloaders.

The “Concept” is an extraordinarily important and indispensable part of the design process. 
Designing without a concept is like traveling without a dream. “Concept” is hot. But “Concept” 
is too hot. Searching for “concept+design” yields as many as 745,000 results—exclusively Dutch 
ones. The “Concept” is the Haarlemmer oil for designers: you can use it for anything. Criticism of a 
design decision is easily deflected with “It’s still in concept.” And if the design turns out not 
to work in practice, it is enough to argue that it is “conceptually very well put together.”

Concept designers may claim that this does not give a good picture of what “conceptual thinking” 
really is. But that claim itself is proof of the proposition. “Concept” is by definition elusive, 
because the word describes itself.

Van Dale thinks so too: “Conceptual art is a movement in art according to which the artist’s choice 
of an object can already make it art.” Can’t go wrong, always good.
Incidentally, I wouldn’t know what non-conceptual art looks like, but that may be down to me. After 
all, I’m a designer, not an artist.

“Concept” might be much better defined as “that which you make before you toss it over the fence 
somewhere.” Going deeper isn’t necessary. Ultimate designer laziness, then. You should especially 
not burden design students—a prevailing idea at academies—with “how” and “why” questions, because then 
they’ll drop out. And that costs a lot of money these days. Testing conceptual results is much safer: 
impossible to challenge, and easy to adjust if too many students don’t seem to make it.
But is it desirable in the long run? Maybe it’s an idea that the idea-havers, the brainstormers, and 
the concept-shapers simply get to work for once.

If you don’t agree: this story is still just a concept."""
